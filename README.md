__Synopsis__  
We are now building a pipeline for smooth communications between web gamers. Intuitively, internet users communicate via sending and receiving messages (data packets) across the web. The protocol that facilitates data transfer is HTTP with its conventional GET, POST method. Adding on top of the HTTP for reliable data transfer is TCP protocol (more advanced algorithm such as TCP Reno). Here we are mainly concerned with our customers' gaming activity and their web-based communication to our game servers. We will use Flask, a small web framework that will do all the jobs in the background for us to send and receive web-based messages generated by kafka. A data flow chart was shown below.

__Procedure__  

In mobile game community, web-based communication is a crucial part of the game development in which players response (events) to game play must be instantly updated in order for players to enjoy playing the game without any glitch. We deployed Kafka for our web-based mobile game called **"Build a Nation"**.  

I laid out a step by step implementation of Kafka in details in the following.  

## In Droplet, Update images 
### 1. Updating Docker Images 
```
docker pull midsw205/base:0.1.8
docker pull confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:latest
docker pull confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest
```
### 2. Logging into the assignment folder
```
cd w205/assignment-09-kckenneth/
```

### 3. Checking what's in my directory 
```
ls  
```

### 4. Making sure at which branch I am on git
```
git branch   
```
### 5. Checking if there's any pre-existing docker containers running
```
docker-compose ps  
docker ps -a  
```

##### if need be, remove any running containers by rm
```
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq) 
```
### 6. Run a single docker container midsw205 in bash mode
```
docker run -it --rm -v /home/science/w205:/w205 midsw205/base:latest bash
```
## Inside the Docker Container
1. check into assignment 9 folder,
2. check git branch, create assignment branch if necessary  
3. create docker-compose.yml with 3 containers
  - zookeeper  
  - kafka  
  - mids  
4. create game_app.py

```
cd assignment-09-kckenneth  
ls  
git status  
git branch 
git checkout -b assignment  
vi docker-compose.yml  
vi game_app.py
exit  
```

## Flask game_app.py in details  
```
#!/usr/bin/env python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
event_logger = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='kafka:29092')
events_topic = 'events'

@app.route("/")
def default_response():
    event_logger.send(events_topic, 'default'.encode())
    return "\nThis is the default response!\n"

@app.route("/purchase_a_sword")
def purchase_sword():
    # business logic to purchase sword
    # log event to kafka
    event_logger.send(events_topic, 'purchased_sword'.encode())
    return "\nSword Purchased!\n"
```

Here we are using game_app.py to call flask module to run. Any messages or events that game players generate from the web such as "purchase a sword", "purchase a horse", "upgrade the arrow", etc etc etc will be fed into Kafka. Therefore we import the **KafkaProducer** library in our game_app.py script. Kafka will then publish those events in json format. In the backend, those messages will be stored and analyzed in our game server (**Data Analytics**). For example, "purchase a sword" events will be stored with its game player ID in our game server. Any game activities that a game player can now pursue or execute because of the possession of a sword will be relayed from the backend game server to the front end so that the player could now execute additional activity in the game due to the possession of the sword.  

## In Droplet, I spin up the cluster in detached mode by -d
```
docker-compose up -d
```
### Check if the zookeeper is up and running by finding the *binding* word in the logs file
```
docker-compose logs zookeeper | grep -i binding  
```
### I also checked kafka is up and running by searching the word *started*
```
docker-compose logs kafka | grep -i started
```
### Run python flask
```
docker-compose exec mids env FLASK_APP=/w205/flask-with-kafka/game_api.py flask run
```
### In another CLI window
```
docker-compose exec mids curl http://localhost:5000/
docker-compose exec mids curl http://localhost:5000/purchase_a_sword
```

## Kafka consumption 

Since we added kafka script in game_app.py that will publish player events (or action), we can consume the events log by kafkacat.  

```
docker-compose exec mids bash -c "kafkacat -C -b kafka:29092 -t events -o beginning -e"
```

## Exit
```
docker-compose down
```
